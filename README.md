# ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Malignancy Detection

## Project Description

Early detection is crucial for surviving skin cancer, but many people don't have access to skin specialists. In recent years, AI algorithms with dermoscopy have proven valuable in aiding clinicians with the diagnosis of melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Screening tools could particularly help underserved communities catch skin cancer early, which is vital for patient survival. However, screening with dermatoscopes would be a challenge as specialized tools to obtain these images are generally available only at dermatology clinics. For AI to help people in general medical practices or at home, it needs to work well with lower-quality images. The goal of this project is to develop an AI algorithm to detect skin cancer malignancy based on the 3D total body photography images that resembles cell phone photos and metadata of each patients.

## Performance Evaluation Parameter

### Partial Area Under the ROC Curve (pAUC)
- The model was evaluated with the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC) parameter above 80% true positive rate (TPR) for binary classification of malignant examples.

## Data Outline
- The data used for training and validation set comes from the SLICE-3D dataset developed by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration.

#### Image data

- 401,059 15mm-by-15mm field-of-view images of skin lesion crops that centered on distinct lesions from the 3D total body photographs (TBP) in JPEG. The images ranges from ... pixels to 

#### Tabular data

- Metadata of the 401,059 samples that include patient demographics (age, sex), anatomical location, lesion characteristics (location, size, shape, and color features), lesion metrics (area, perimeter, color irregularity, contrast, asymmetry), 3D coordinates, etc.

| **LGBM**         | 50  | 561        | 0.149          |

*Note:
- **Early Stopping Epoch Parameter** : Number of training epochs to wait before stopping if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve
- **Valid Set pAUC** : pAUC results from assessing data from the validation dataset during model training
