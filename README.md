# ISIC 2024 Skin Cancer Malignancy Detection

## Project Description

## Performance Evaluation Parameter

### Partial Area Under the ROC Curve (pAUC)
  
- The model was evaluated with the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC) parameter above 80% true positive rate (TPR) for binary classification of malignant examples.

## Data Outline

#### The data used for training and validation set comes from the SLICE-3D dataset

#### Image data

401,059 JPEG of 15mm-by-15mm field-of-view images of skin lesion crops that centered on distinct lesions from the 3D total body photographs (TBP). The images ranges from ... pixels to 

#### Tabular data
